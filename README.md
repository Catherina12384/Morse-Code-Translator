# Morse-Code-Translator

## Overview
The Morse Code Converter is a simple Java application that provides functionality to convert text to Morse code and vice versa. The application supports both encryption (text to Morse code) and decryption (Morse code to text) operations.

## Features
### Encrypt: 
  Converts a string of text into Morse code.
### Decrypt: 
  Converts a Morse code string back into readable text.

## Usage
Upon running the application, you'll be presented with a menu to choose between encryption and decryption.

### Encryption: 
  Enter 1 to convert text into Morse code. Input the text when prompted.
### Decryption: 
  Enter 2 to convert Morse code into text. Input the Morse code when prompted.

## Code Details
### Morse Code Mapping: 
  The morse map contains the mapping of characters to Morse code and vice versa.
### Encrypt Method:   
  Converts text to Morse code by looking up each character in the morse map.
### Decrypt Method: 
  Converts Morse code back to text by looking up each Morse code sequence in the Rev_morse map.
